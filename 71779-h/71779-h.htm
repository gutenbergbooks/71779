<h2><a id="Preface"></a>Preface.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> has the beneficent Creator scattered over the face of the earth such
a profusion of beautiful flowers&mdash;flowers by the thousand and million,
in every land&mdash;from the tiny snowdrop that gladdens the chill spring of
the north, to the gorgeous magnolia that flaunts in the sultry regions
of the tropics? Why is it that every landscape has its appropriate
flowers, every nation its national flowers, every rural home its home
flowers? Why do flowers enter and shed their perfume over every scene of
life, from the cradle to the grave? Why are flowers made to utter all
voices of joy and sorrow in all varying scenes, from the chaplet that
adorns the bride to the votive wreath that blooms over the tomb?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is for no other reason than that flowers have in themselves a real
and natural significance. They have a positive relation to man, his
sentiments, passions, and feelings. They correspond to actual emotions.
They have their mission&mdash;a mission of love and mercy. They have their
language, and from the remotest ages this language has found its
interpreters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the East the language of flowers has been universally understood and
applied “time out of mind.” Its meaning finds a place in their poetry
and in all their literature, and it is familiarly known among the
people. In Europe it has existed and been recognised for long ages among
the people, although scarcely noticed by the literati until a
comparatively recent period. Shakspeare, however, whom nothing escaped
which was known to the people, exhibits his intimate acquaintance with
the language of flowers in his masterly delineation of the madness of
Ophelia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recent</span> writers in all languages recognise the beauty and propriety of
this language to such an extent, that an acquaintance with it has now
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_7">{7}</a></span>become indispensable as a part of a polished education.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> little volume is devoted to the explanation of this beautiful
language. We have made it as complete as our materials and limits would
permit. We present it to our readers in the humble hope that we shall
increase the means of elegant and innocent enjoyment by our “Floral
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_9">{9}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_8">{8}</a></span>Offering.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> shrub, clothed in its showy garb, appears amidst the snow, like an
imprudent and coquettish female, who, though shivering with cold, wears
her spring attire in the depth of winter. The stalk of this shrub is
covered with a dry bark, which gives it the appearance of dead wood.
Nature, to hide this deformity, has encircled each of its sprays with a
wreath of red flowers, terminating in a tuft of leaves. These flowers
give out a peculiar and offensive smell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Snowdrop is looked upon as the herald of the approach of
flower-wreathed Spring. The north winds howl; the naked branches of the
trees are white with frost; the earth is carpeted with the virgin snow;
the feathered musicians are silent; and stern Winter’s icy hand chills
the rivulet till it ceases to murmur. At this season, a tender flower
springs up amid the snow, expands its blossoms, and leads thought to the
verdant hours to come. This beautiful sign of awakening Nature may aptly
be considered as the emblem of Hope.</p>

<h2><a id="Almond_Blossom_Indiscretion"></a><span class="smcap">Almond Blossom.</span> ... <i>Indiscretion.</i></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Almond tree is the first of the trees to put forth its blossoms,
when spring breathes the breath of life through nature. It has been made
the emblem of indiscretion, from flowering so early that frosts too
often give a death-chill to the precocious germs of its fruit. In
ancient times, the abundance of blossoms upon the Almond tree was
considered to promise a fruitful season. The following is the fabulous
account of the origin of this tree:&mdash;Demophoon, son of Theseus and
Phædra, in returning from the siege of Troy, was thrown by a storm on
the shores of Thrace, where then reigned the beautiful Phyllis. The
young queen graciously received the prince, fell in love with him, and
became his wife. When recalled to Athens by his father’s death,
Demophoon promised to return in a month, and fixed the day. The loving
Phyllis counted the hours of his absence, and, at last, the appointed
day arrived. Nine times she repaired to the shore; but, losing all hope
of his return, she died of grief, and was converted into an Almond tree.
Soon afterwards, Demophoon returned. Overwhelmed with sorrow, he offered
a sacrifice at the sea-side, to appease the manes of his bride. The
Almond tree instantly put forth its blossoms, and seemed to sympathize
with his repentance.</p>

England, though not considered to be really a native of the country. We
learn from the favourite writers, Mr. and Mrs. Howitt, that they are

the breast of the lover of the beautiful, as he strolls through the

<p><span class="smcap">and</span> succeeding poets have generally used it as the image of that pure

of the Dryads, who were supposed to preside over meadows and pastures.
While dancing on the turf with Ephigeus, whose suit she encouraged, she
attracted the admiration of Vertumnus, the deity who presided over
orchards; and, to escape from him, she was transformed into the humble
flower, the Latin name of which is Bellis. The ancient English name of
the flower was Day’s Eye, of which Daisy is a corruption. In Ossian’s
poems, the Daisy is called the flower of the new-born&mdash;most expressive
of innocence.</p>

<h2><a id="Tulip_Declaration_of_Love"></a><span class="smcap">Tulip</span>.... <i>Declaration of Love</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Tulip is an extraordinary favourite in many parts of Europe and
Asia; and, in Holland and Turkey, the most extravagant prices are paid
for fine specimens. On account of the elegance of its form, the beauty
of its colours, and its want of fragrance and other useful qualities,
this flower has been considered as an appropriate symbol of a female who
possesses no recommendation but a beautiful appearance. In the East, the
Tulip is employed as the emblem by which a lover makes known his passion
to his mistress; as the Tulip expresses the idea that he has a face all
fire and a heart all coal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ancients consecrated the Cypress to the Fates, the Furies and Pluto.
They placed it near tombs. The people of the East retain the same custom
in the decoration of their cemeteries. The Turks plant the Cypress at
the head and at the foot of the graves. According to Ovid, the Cypress
derived its name from Cyparissos, an especial friend of Apollo’s, who,
in grief at having inadvertently killed a favourite stag of his, prayed
the gods that his mourning might be made perpetual, and was changed into
a Cypress tree, the branches of which were thenceforward used at
funerals.</p>

<h2><a id="Hawthorn_Hope"></a><span class="smcap">Hawthorn</span>.... <i>Hope</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Various</span> significations have been given to the Hawthorn. Among the Turks,
a branch of it expresses the wish of a lover to receive a kiss from the
object of his affection. Among the ancient Greeks, the Hawthorn was a
symbol of conjugal union; its blossomed boughs were carried about at
their wedding festivities, and the newly-married couple were even
lighted to their bridal chamber with torches made of its wood. In
England, the Hawthorn is used in the sports of May-days, and is,
therefore, frequently called May. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_53">{53}</a></span> proverb among the rural
inhabitants of that country, that a “store of haws portend cold
winters.” Though the Hawthorn is quoted as the emblem of Hope, it must
be considered more particularly as the lover’s hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Butterfly Orchis is rather rare except where there is a chalky soil.
The Spider Orchis has gained its name from the great resemblance it
bears to one of those large, fat-bodied garden spiders, which are often
noticed for the singular beauty of the markings on their backs. Another
is so very like a fly, that it is named the Fly Orchis; another is like
a lizard, or some strange reptile, and the flowers being yellow, green,
and purple, and twisted in and about one another in a very odd way, it
really looks like some horrible group of queer living creatures. One,
from being fancied like a man, is called Man Orchis; another, very gayly
spotted, and ornamented with a helmet-like<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_62">{62}</a></span> appendage, is the Military
Orchis; another is called Bee Orchis. Bishop Mant thus alludes to some

<h2><a id="Box_Stoicism"></a><span class="smcap">Box</span>.... <i>Stoicism</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> common Box, of which our hedge is formed, is indigenous in England,
preferring the chalky hills of Surrey and Kent for its residence, but
flourishing well on other soils. It is one of the most useful evergreen
shrubs we possess, and especially as it will grow under the drip and
shadow of other trees, as you know is the case with our hedge. It is
found in most European countries, from Britain southwards, also about
Mount Caucasus, Persia, China, Cochin China, and America. It was
formerly much more common in England than now, having disappeared under
the spread of agriculture. Box-hill, in Surrey, is named from this tree,
and is a conical elevation covered with a wood of Box-trees, some of
large size. Boxley in Kent, and Boxwell in Gloucestershire, are also
named from it. The leaf and general appearance of the tree are too
familiar to require any description. The scent of the spring blossoms is
rather powerful, and to some persons unpleasant. The timber is very
valuable, it is sold by weight, and, being very hard and smooth, and not
apt to warp, is well adapted for many nice and delicate purposes. In the
days of good old Evelyn, it appears to have been as much used as at
present, for he says, “It is good for the turner, engraver, carver,
mathematical instrument maker, comb and pipe, or flute-maker, and the
roots for the inlayer and cabinet-maker. Of box are made wheels,
sheaves, pins, pegs for musical instruments, nut-crackers,
button-moulds, weavers’ shuttles, hollar-sticks, bump-sticks, and
dressers for the shoe<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_64">{64}</a></span>maker, rulers, rolling-pins, pestles, mall-balls,
beetles, tops, chessmen, tables, screws, bobbins for bone-lace, spoons,
knife-handles, but especially combs.” Most of those engravings in books,
called wood-cuts, are done upon Box wood, and for that purpose English
Box is superior to any other, though a great portion of what is used in
this country comes from the Levant. The ancients used combs made of
Box-wood, and also instruments to be played on with the mouth. The
Romans used to adorn their gardens with it, clipped into form, as we
find from mention being made of clipped Box-trees by their writers. It
was formerly much cut in this manner here, and was ranked next to the
Yew for its capabilities of taking artificial and grotesque forms; but
except a few ancient hedges of Box, like our own, and those at Castle
Bromwich Hall, where the Yew hedges are also preserved, there are not
many vestiges of its former garden-glory remaining. A dwarf kind is used
for making a neat and firm edging to flower borders, for which nothing
answers so well, or produces so proper an effect.</p>

better known as the Daffodil, and bears much resemblance to the Yellow

in the decorations of their first magnificent temple; and Christ
described it as more splendid than King Solomon in his most gorgeous
apparel. According to ancient mythology, there was originally but one
species of Lily, and that was orange-coloured; and the white was
produced by the following circumstance:&mdash;Jupiter, wishing to render
Hercules immortal, prevailed on Juno to take a deep draught of nectar,
which threw the queen into a profound sleep. Jupiter then placed the
infant Hercules at her breast, so that the divine milk might ensure
immortality. Hercules drew the milk faster than he could swallow it, and
some drops fell to the earth, from which immediately sprang the White
Lily.</p>

<h2><a id="Marigold_Grief"></a><span class="smcap">Marigold</span>.... <i>Grief</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Marigold is the conventional emblem of distress of mind. It is
distinguished by many singular properties. It blossoms the whole year,
and on that account, the Romans termed it the flower of the calends, or
of all the months. Its flowers are open only from nine in the morning
till three in the afternoon. They always follow the course of the sun,
by turning from east to west as he proceeds upon his daily journey. In
July and August these flowers emit, during the night, small luminous
sparks. Alone, the Marigold expresses grief; interwoven with other
flowers, the varied events of life; the cloud and sunshine of ill and
good.</p>

<h2><a id="Red_Rose_Beauty_and_Love"></a><span class="smcap">Red Rose</span>.... <i>Beauty and Love</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to ancient fable, the red colour of the Rose may be traced to
Venus, whose delicate foot, when she was hastening to the relief of her
beloved Adonis, was pierced by a thorn that drew blood,</p>

<span class="iauth"><i>Herrick.</i><br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miller</span>, the “basket-maker” and poet, gives the following beautiful
account of the origin of the Red Rose:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">It</span> was drawing toward the decline of a beautiful summer day, when
the red, round sun was bending down a deep, blue, unclouded sky, to
where a vast range of mountains stretched, summit upon summit, and
in the far distance again rose, pile upon pile, until high over all
towered the god-haunted height of cloud-capt Olympus, rising with
its rounded shoulder, like another world, on the uttermost rim of
the horizon. At the foot of this immense world of untrodden
mountains, opened out a wide, immeasurable forest, stretching far
away, league upon league, with its unexplored ocean of trees, which
were bounded somewhere by another range of unknown mountains, that
again overlooked a vast, silent, and unpeopled world. On the edge
of this pathless desert of trees, and nearest<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_78">{78}</a></span> the foot of Olympus,
sat the Queen of Beauty and of Love; with her golden tresses
unbound, and her matchless countenance buried within the palms of
her milk-white hands, and sobbing as if her fond, immortal heart
would break. Beside her was laid the dead body of Adonis, his face
half-hidden beneath the floating fall of her hair, as she bent over
him and wept. Beyond them lay the stiffened bulk of the grim and
grisly boar, his hideous jaws flecked with blood and foam, and his
terrible tusks glittering like the heads of pointed spears, as they
stood out, sharp and white, in the unclouded sunset. Not an
immortal comforter was by: for the far-seeing eye of Jove was fixed
listlessly upon the golden nectar-cup, as it passed from hand to
hand, along the rounded circle of the gods, while they were
recounting the deeds of other days, when they waged war against the
Titans. Even the chariot of Venus stood unyoked at the foot of the
mount; the silken traces lay loosely thrown together upon the
ground, and the white doves were idly hovering round in the air;
for the weeping goddess was so overwhelmed with sorrow, that she
had forgotten to waft her light-winged whisper to the Mount of
Olympus; nor had they received any summons from the charioteer
Love, who lay sleeping upon a bed of Roses, with his bow and arrows
by his side.</p>

<p>In the glade of this vast forest of the old primeval world, whose
echoes had never been startled by the blows of a descending axe,
nor a branch rent from their majestic boles, saving by the dreaded
bolts of the Thunderer, or some earth-shaking storm, which, in his
anger, he had blown abroad, the Goddess of Beauty<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_79">{79}</a></span> still continued
to sit, as if unconscious of the savage solitude which surrounded
her; nor did she notice the back-kneed Satyrs, that peered upon her
unrobed loveliness with burning eyes, from many a shadowy recess in
the thick-leaved underwood. Upon the trunks of the mighty and
storm-tortured trees, the sunset here and there flashed down in
rays of molten gold, making their gnarled and twisted stems look as
if they had just issued red-hot from the jaws of some cavern-like
furnace, whose glare the fancy might still trace in a blackened
avenue of trees, up which the red ranks of the consuming lightning
had ages agone marched. Every way, where the lengthened shadows of
evening began to fall in deeper masses, the forest assumed a more
savage look, which was heightened by the noise of some
deadly-tusked boar, as he went snorting and thundering through the
thicket; the growl of the tiger was also heard at intervals, as he
retreated farther into the deepening darkness of the dingles,
mistaking the blazing sunset for some devouring fire. But the eyes
of Venus saw only the pale face of her lover,&mdash;she felt only his
chilly and stiffened hand sink colder and deeper into the warm
heart on which she pressed it, and over which her tears fell,
slower or faster, just as the mournful gusts of her sorrow arose or
subsided, and sent the blinding rain from the blue-veined lids that
overhung her clouded eyes; for never had her immortal heart before
been swollen by such an overflowing torrent of grief. But the
warmth of her kisses, which would almost have awakened life in a
statue of marble, fell upon lips now cold as a wintry grave; and
her sighs, which came sweeter than the morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_80">{80}</a></span> air when it first
arises from its sleep among the Roses, stirred not one of the
clotted ringlets which softened into the yielding whiteness of her
heavenly bosom,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“She looked upon his lips, and they are pale;<br></span>
<span class="i2">She took him by the hand, and that was cold;<br></span>
<span class="i0">She whispered in his ear a heavy tale,<br></span>
<span class="i2">As if they heard the woful words she told.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">She would have given her immortality but to have heard those lips
murmur and complain, as they had done a few hours before&mdash;to have
seen those eyes again burning with disdain, as they flashed back
indignantly the warm advances of her love. She pictured him as he
had that very morning stood, in all the pride of youthful manliness
and beauty, when he looked down, blushing and abashed, as he held
his boar-spear in his hand, when she threw the studded bridle over
her own rounded and naked arm, and the proud courser pricked up his
ears with delight, and shook his braided mane, while his long tail
streamed out like a banner, and his proud eye dilated, and his
broad nostrils expanded, as he went trampling haughtily on, proud
to be led by the Queen of Beauty and of Love. She pictured the
Primrose bank on which he lay twined reluctantly in her arms, how
he tried to conceal his face, this way, and that way, among the
flowers, whenever she attempted to press his lips,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“While on each cheek appeared a pretty dimple:<br></span>
<span class="i2">Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He might be buried in a tomb so simple.”<br></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_81">{81}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">She recalled his attitude as he untwined himself from her embrace,
and hurried off in pursuit of his steed, which had snapped the rein
that secured it to the branch of a neighbouring oak, and started at
full speed down one of the wild avenues of the forest. In fancy she
again saw him, as he sat panting upon the ground, weary with the
fruitless pursuit; and how, kneeling down, she then</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">“Took him gently by the hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A lily prisoned in a jail of snow,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Or ivory in an alabaster band:<br></span>
<span class="i0">So white a friend engirt so white a foe;<br></span>
<span class="i2">A beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Showed like two silver doves that sat a-billing.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">And as she looked upon him, she imagined that his lips moved again,
as when they said, “Give me my hand, why dost thou feel it?” she
fancied she again felt his face upon her cheek&mdash;his kisses upon her
lips, as when she fell down and feigned herself dead; the while he
bent her fingers, and felt her pulse, and endeavoured by a hundred
endearments and tender expressions, to restore her. And how, when
she pretended to recover, she paid him back again with unnumbered
kisses, whilst he, wearied with opposing her, no longer offered any
resistance; and how, at last, he broke from her fair arms, and,
darting down the “dark lawn,” left her seated alone upon the
ground.</p>

<p>As picture after picture rose before her of what had been, and
every close pressure of the cold, inanimate, but still dearly-loved
form, told her what the hand of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_82">{82}</a></span> death had done, and that those
very “hopes and fears which are akin to love” were now for ever
darkened and extinguished; she burst forth into such a loud,
wailing lamentation, that the sound found its way unto Olympus, and
fell upon the ever-open ear of Jove, who, in a moment, dashed the
golden nectar-cup upon the ground, which he was about uplifting to
his lips, and sprang upon his feet. There was a sound of hurrying
to and fro over the mountain-summits, which sloped down to the edge
of the forest&mdash;of gods and goddesses passing through the air&mdash;of
golden chariots, that went whistling along like the wind, as they
cleft their rapid way&mdash;and the flapping of dark, immortal wings,
between which many a beautiful divinity was seated. The golden
clouds of sunset gathered red and ominously about the rounded
summit of Olympus, and a blood-red light glared upon such parts of
the forest as were not darkened by the deepening shadows of the
approaching twilight,&mdash;for the Thunderer had stamped his immortal
foot, and jarred the mighty mountain to its very base. And now, in
that forest glade, which but a few moments before was so wild and
desolate,&mdash;where only the forms of the grisly boar, the dead
Adonis, and the weeping Goddess of Beauty broke the level lines of
the angry sunset, were assembled the stern Gods, and the weeping
Graces, and the fluttering Loves that ever hover around the chariot
of Venus. With bleeding feet and drooping head,&mdash;wan, and cold, and
speechless,&mdash;was the Goddess of Beauty lifted into her golden
chariot, and, with the dead body of Adonis, wafted by her silver
and silent-winged doves to Mount Olympus. And then a deep darkness
settled down<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_83">{83}</a></span> upon the forest. When the next morning’s sun arose
and gilded those silent glades, the Roses, on which the blood of
the Goddess of Beauty had fallen, and which were ever before white,
were changed into a delicate crimson; and wherever a tear had
fallen, there had sprung up a flower which the earth had never
before borne, and that was the Lily of the Valley; and wherever a
ruddy drop had fallen from the death-wound of Adonis sprang up the
red flower which still beareth his name. Even the white
apple-blossoms, which he clutched in his agony, ever after wore the
ruddy stain which they caught from his folded fingers; and the
drowsy Poppy grew up everywhere around the spot, as if to denote
that the only consolation which can be found for sorrow is the
long, unbroken sleep of death. Thus the Rose, which was before
white, became red, and was ever after dedicated to Beauty and Love.</p></div>

has varied the colour from the darkest purple to the purest white. Under
all its diversities, however, it retains its delicious, spicy fragrance,
and hence has been made the emblem of woman’s love, which no
circumstance can change. Florists designate two principal divisions of
these flowers, Pinks and Carnation. The former are marked by a spot
resembling an eye, and by a more humble growth. The flower of the
Carnation is much larger than that of the Pink, and of a deeper hue. The
Carnation was called by some of the old English writers the clove-gilly
flower, from its perfume resembling that of cloves.</p>

of all hues, bright butterflies, and vigilant bees for ever surround the

<h2><a id="Laurel_Glory"></a><span class="smcap">Laurel</span>.... <i>Glory</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Laurel was consecrated to every
species of glory. The beautiful shrub grows abundantly at Delphi, on the
banks of the river Peneus. There its aromatic and evergreen branches
shoot up to the height of the loftiest trees; and it is alleged that, by
means of some secret virtue, they avert lightning from the spots which
they adorn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to ancient fable, Daphne was the daughter of the river Peneus.
Apollo fell in love with her, but she, preferring virtue to the love of
the most eloquent of the gods, fled, in order to avoid the seducing
magic of his words. Apollo pursued, and was on the point of overtaking
her, when the nymph invoked her father, and was changed into a Laurel.
The god, finding that he clasped an insensible tree in his arms, kissed
its bright leaves. “Since thou canst not be my spouse,” said he, “thou
shalt, at least, be my tree.” Thence-forward the Laurel was sacred to
Apollo.</p>

<h2><a id="Strawberry_Perfection"></a><span class="smcap">Strawberry</span>.... <i>Perfection</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> eminent French author conceived the plan of writing a general history
of nature, after the model of the ancients. A Strawberry plant, which,
perchance, grew under his window, deterred him from this bold design. He
examined the Strawberry, and, in so doing, discovered so many wonders,
that he felt convinced the study of a single plant was sufficient to
occupy a whole lifetime. He therefore gave up the pompous title which he
had meditated for his work, and contented himself with calling it
“Studies of Nature.” The flowers of the Strawberry form pretty bouquets;
but, as the delicious fruit is preferred to the flower, they are seldom
plucked for that purpose. Among the glaciers of the Alps, the plants and
flowers of the Strawberry are found in all seasons of the year. The
plant seems to possess all the merits of plants, in their greatest
perfection. The berries are the favourite accompaniment of the lordly
feast and the most exquisite luxury of the rural repast. They vie in
freshness and perfume with the buds of the sweetest flowers; delighting
the eye, the taste, and smell, at the same time.</p>

<h2><a id="Sunflower_False_Riches"></a><span class="smcap">Sunflower</span>.... <i>False Riches</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Sunflower has been thus named from the resemblance which its broad
golden disk and rays bear to the sun. The first Spaniards who arrived in
Peru were amazed at the profuse display of gold among the people, but
they were still more astonished when, in May, they beheld whole fields
covered with these flowers, which they concluded, at first sight, must
be of the same precious metal. From this circumstance, and the
observation that gold, however abundant, cannot render a person truly
rich, the Sunflower has been made the emblem of false wealth. Many of
the English poets have adopted the notion that this flower ever turns
its face to the sun. Thomson, Moore, Darwin, and Barton make a very fine
use of the idea. But it is not a fact. Those flowers which face the east
at the opening of day, never turn to the west at the close of it.</p>

bluish-white. It is a general favourite of the fair sex, and is

<h2><a id="Jasmine_Amiability"></a><span class="smcap">Jasmine</span>.... <i>Amiability</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Jasmine is a happy emblem of an amiable disposition. In all
situations, it suffers the gardener to train its slender branches into
any form he chooses: most commonly forming a living tapestry for arbours
and garden walls, and everywhere throwing out a profusion of delicate
and charming flowers, which perfume the air. The poets have showered
their praise upon this plant, and all unite in considering it the emblem
of the winsome quality of amiability. After paying a glowing tribute to
the beauty and sweetness of the Violet, Thomas Miller, the
“basket-maker” poet, thus speaks of the Jasmine:<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_110">{110}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stepping</span> further into summer, comes the star-white Jasmine,&mdash;that sweet
perfumer of the night, which only throws out its full fragrance when its
sister stars are keeping watch in the sky; as if, when the song of the
nightingale no longer cheered the darkness, it sent forth its silent
aroma upon the listening air. Many a happy home does it garland, and
peeps in at many a forbidden lattice, where Love and Beauty repose.
Little did the proud courtiers and stately dames of Queen Elizabeth’s
day dream that this sweet-scented creeper (a sprig of which seemed to
make the haughty haughtier still) would one day become so common as to
cluster around and embower thousands of humble English cottages,&mdash;a
degradation which, could they but have witnessed, would almost have made
every plait of their starched ruffs bristle up, like “quills upon the
fretful porcupine.” Beautiful are its long, drooping, dark-green shoots,
trailing around the trellis-work of a door-way, like a green curtain
embroidered with silver flowers; while here and there the queenly
Moss-Rose, creeping in and out like the threads of a fanciful tapestry,
its crimson face amid the embowered green,&mdash;a beautiful lady peeping
through a leaf-clad casement.</p>

<h2><a id="Forget-me-not"></a><span class="smcap">Forget-me-not.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name of this flower expresses clearly enough the meaning which is
given to it. As a remembrancer it is universally received and eulogized.
The name is derived from a German tradition, full of melancholy romance.
It is related that a young couple, on the eve of being united, while
walking along the banks of the Danube, saw a cluster of these flowers,
floating on the stream, which was bearing it away. The affianced bride
admired the beauty of the flower, and lamented its fatal destiny. The
lover plunged into the water to secure it. No sooner had he caught it
than he found himself sinking; but, making a last effort, he threw it on
the bank at the feet of his betrothed, and, at the moment of
disappearing for ever, exclaimed, “<i>Vergiss mein nicht!</i>” Since that
event, this flower has been made emblematical of the sentiment,
Forget-me-not. Its corollas are of a soft cerulean-blue colour, and it
presents an interesting appearance as it grows along the banks of the
rivers. The Forget-me-not is found in great perfection on the banks of a
small stream near Luxembourg, in France. The stream is called the
Fairies’ Bath, and its banks are the favourite resort of festive
parties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Rosemary is so often mentioned by our early writers, both in prose,
poetry, and our oldest dramas, that a long article, possessing great

The Rosemary was used both at their feasts and their funerals,&mdash;the
christening-cup was stirred with it, and it was worn at their marriage
ceremonies. Shakspeare has chosen it for the emblem of Remembrance, and
who would attempt to change the meaning of a flower which his genius has
hallowed, or disturb a leaf over which he has breathed his holy
“superstition?”&mdash;in memory of him we use the latter word in all
reverence. A few years ago it was customary, in many parts of England,
to plant slips of Rosemary over the dead; nor has the practice yet
fallen altogether into disuse&mdash;rural cemeteries will revive these
ancient customs. Shakspeare chose the Rosemary as the emblem of
affectionate remembrance, for its flowering in winter,&mdash;a very poetic

<h2><a id="Anemone_Forsaken"></a><span class="smcap">Anemone</span>.... <i>Forsaken</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Anemone</span> was a nymph, beloved by Zephyr. Flora, jealous of her, banished
her from her court and transformed her into a flower, that blows before
the return of spring. Zephyr has abandoned this unhappy beauty to the
rude caresses of Boreas, who, unable to gain her love, harshly shakes
her, half opens her blossoms, and causes her immediately to fade. An
Anemone, with these words, <i>Brevis est usus</i>&mdash;“Her reign is short”&mdash;is
touchingly expressive of the transitory nature of beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> spring the green woods of merry England are covered with the flowers
of the Anemone. Turn the eye whichever way you will, there it greets you
like “a pleasant thought;” it forms a bed of flowers around the foot of
the mighty oak, and below the tangling brambles, which you may peep
between, but cannot pass,&mdash;there, also, are its pearly blossoms bending.
The Greeks named it the flower of the Wind, and so plentiful is it in
our country that we might fancy the breeze had blown it everywhere. The
gaudy Anemone of the garden, the emblem of forsaken love, is known to
all; but our favourites are the uncultivated offspring of the windy
woods, which come long before the broad green leaves hang overhead to
shelter them.</p>

<h2><a id="Moss_Maternal_Love"></a><span class="smcap">Moss</span>.... <i>Maternal Love</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Moss</span> is selected to be the emblem of maternal love, because, like that
love, it glads the heart when the winter of adversity overtakes us, and
when summer friends have deserted us. Rousseau, so long the prey of his
own passions, and tormented by those of other men, soothed the latter
years of his life by the study of nature. The Mosses, in particular,
attracted his attention. It is these, he would say, that give a look of
youth and freshness to the fields, at the moment when the flowers have
gone to their graves. In winter the Mosses offer to the eye of the lover
of nature their carpet of emerald green, their secret nuptials, and the
charming mysteries of the urns and amphoræ which enclose their
posterity. It is asserted that without the Mosses, part of our globe
would be uninhabitable. At the northern extremity of the earth, the
Laplanders cover their subterranean abodes with Moss, and thus defy the
longest and most terrible winters. Their numerous herds of reindeer have
no other food, yet they supply their owners with delicious milk,
nutritious flesh, and warm clothing; thus combining for the poor
Laplander all the advantages that we derive from the horse, cow, and
sheep.</p>

<span class="i0">The docile, swift Reindeer! Oh, when I was a child,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I loved all strange fantastic tales, the wondrous and the wild;<br></span>
<span class="i0">I read about the “Hundred Nights,” in the Arabian Tales,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That tell of Genii, sprites, and dwarfs, of gold and diamond vales.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I read of Eastern gardens and palaces so rare,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Some piles of dark old books there were, amid the motley crowd,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And when tall enough to reach them, oh! glad was I, and proud.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And there I found old Æsop, whose fables we all know,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Cookery-books of ancient dates, most grim and well worn too.<br></span>
<span class="i0">These I just peeped at, and put back&mdash;and still went groping on<br></span>
<span class="i0">Deep into that small mine of wealth that I so late had won.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_127">{127}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Soon with some daring tugs, I brought a lumbering volume slap<br></span>

<span class="i0">The binding was antique and worn&mdash;the title-page was out,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And yet the treasure won from me a child’s exultant shout;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For there were pictures many, of beast, and fish, and bird;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>thou</i> wert there, thou good Reindeer, of whom so much I’d heard.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And that great heavy ancient book was such a prize to me!<br></span>
<span class="i0">It told me of the monstrous whale, and the small good honey-bee;<br></span>
<span class="i0">It told me of the elephant, the tiger, the gazelle,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Of humming-birds that sip the dew of flowers as they fly,<br></span>

<span class="i0">I read about the harmless seals, and the shaggy Polar bear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the mighty troops of hungry wolves that roam and riot there.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I read of Nature’s glorious works, and wondering went on,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And found before me pleasures, whose round will ne’er be done.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_128">{128}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And in my good old-fashioned book I read of herb and tree,<br></span>

<span class="i0">I read of grove-like banyans, of cedars broad and tall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the lofty towering palm, and the Moss and lichen small.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And then I found how wondrously the poor Reindeer was fed,<br></span>

<span class="i0">How, in the woods of scattered pine abundantly it grows,<br></span>

<span class="i0">How the sagacious Reindeer delves, and scents his onward way,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till he reaches his scant mossy food, that doth his toil repay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! see him with his master’s sledge! How swift they glide along,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Like a bird, or a fairy car I’ve read of, in some quaint old song.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Away! o’er the boundless snowy waste, so glittering and bright:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Away!&mdash;through the dark pine forest, as gloomy as the night:<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_129">{129}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Away o’er the frozen lake, the river, and the fen,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Ay, winsome steeds in sooth, with their antlers branched and high;<br></span>
<span class="i0">So sure of foot, and swift of pace, they truly seem to fly.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ye need no palace-stables, no saucy pampered grooms,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To stretch your cracking purse-strings, and strut in liveried plumes;<br></span>
<span class="i0">No heavy half-year’s bills, for oats, beans, straw, and hay.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The forest yields them lodgment, and food, where’er they stray.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thus we find, in every clime, things beautiful and fair,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Each fitted to fulfil its task of use and beauty there;<br></span>

predicting calm or storm. The globes formed by the seeds of the

object of your love, pluck one of those feathery spheres, charge each of
the little feathers with a tender thought; turn toward the spot where
the loved one dwells; blow, and the aërial travellers will faithfully
convey your secret message to his or her feet. If you wish to know if
that dear one is thinking of you, blow again; and if a single aigrette

<h2><a id="Poppy_Consolation"></a><span class="smcap">Poppy</span>.... <i>Consolation</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Red Poppy is the floral symbol of consolation. The White Poppy is
supposed to express, “My bane, my antidote.” The juice extracted from
these plants is employed to soothe the restless invalid to sleep, and to
ease the pangs of disease. According to the mythology of the Grecians,
the Poppy owed its origin to Ceres, who created it to assuage her grief,
during her search after her daughter Proserpine, who was carried off by
Pluto. The Poppy is extensively cultivated in Europe, for the purpose of
making opium from it. Many species are cultivated in the garden. The
double flowers possess surpassing beauty, whether we consider their
delicate texture, elegance of shape, or variety of colouring. In the
time of Gesner, the celebrated botanist of Switzerland, the village
Damons and Chloes proved the sincerity of their lovers by placing in the
hollow of the palm of the left-hand, a petal, or flower-leaf of the
Poppy, which, on being struck by the other hand, was broken with a sharp
sound, which denoted true attachment; but faithlessness, when it failed
to snap.</p>

rose. Stocks are produced of various colours, but the bright red or
carmine must ever remain the favourite variety. The principal branches
of this fragrant family are the Ten-week Stock, so named from flowering
about ten weeks after it is sown; and the Brompton, which does not bloom
till about twelve months after sowing, and was first cultivated in the
neighbourhood of Brompton, England.</p>

<h2><a id="Scarlet_Geranium_Stupidity"></a><span class="smcap">Scarlet Geranium</span>.... <i>Stupidity</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many varieties of the Geranium, distinguished by the shape and
hue of the flowers and leaves, and the difference in their fragrance.
The Scarlet Geranium is a very beautiful flower, but its scent is
disagreeable. The following anecdote will give the reason of its being
chosen as the emblem of stupidity. Madame de Staël was always angry when
any of her acquaintance attempted to introduce a stupid person into her
company. One day, one of her friends ventured to bring to her a young
Swiss officer of most prepossessing exterior. The lady, pleased with his
appearance, was very lively, and said a thousand flattering things to
the new-comer, who seemed at first to be struck mute by surprise and
admiration. When, however, he had listened to her for above an hour
without opening his lips, she began to suspect the cause of his silence,
and put to him such direct questions that he could not help answering.
His answers were extremely silly! Madame de Staël, vexed at having
thrown away her time and her wit, turned to her friend and said:
“Indeed, sir, you are like my gardener, who thought to do me a pleasure
by bringing me this morning a pot of Geranium: but I can tell you that I
made him take back the flower, desiring him not to let me see it any
more.” “And why so?” asked the young man in astonishment. “It was, since
you wish to know, because the Geranium is a beautiful scarlet flower;
while<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_148">{148}</a></span> you look at it, it pleases the eye; but when you press it ever so
slightly, it gives out a disagreeable smell.” So saying, Madame de Staël
rose and went out of the room, leaving the young fool abashed and in
confusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> superb Tuberose is a native of the East Indies and South America,
and was introduced into Europe in 1632. It has since spread all over the
world. The flower is of a white colour, sometimes tinged with a blush of
pink. Its perfume is delicious and powerful; but if you would enjoy it
without danger, keep at some distance from the plant. If you come with
the object of your affection to inhale its perfume by moonlight, when
the nightingale is pouring forth its ravishing melody, these odours will
add an inexpressible charm to your enjoyment; but, if, regardless of the
precepts of moderation, you approach too near, this divine flower will
then be but an enchantress who will pour a dangerous poison into your
bosom. Thus the love which comes from above purifies and exalts; but
that which springs from earth debases and proves the bane of imprudent
youth.</p>

dull-looking foliage, but on the approach of night, they revive, display
their charms, and unfold their prodigious bells, which nature has
coloured with purple, lined with ivory; and to which she has given an
odour that attracts and intoxicates, but is so dangerous as to stupify
those who inhale it even in the open air. It is a dangerous plant to be
allowed to grow where children go, as the beauty of its flowers and
fruit is liable to tempt them to their destruction; since it possesses
so poisonous a quality as to produce paralysis, and even madness, in
those who have eaten it. Its leaves have been recommended for coughs and
asthma. The charms of the Thorn-Apple flower are beautiful, but deadly;
like those of the corrupt and treacherous, to be found in every society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larkspur</span>, Lark’s-claw, Lark-heels, and Lark’s-toe have been given in
allusion to the long spur-like nectary, which has been whimsically
supposed to represent these things, and many more. The Latin name,
<i>Delphinium</i>, is from the Greek, Dolphin, because the nectary was
thought like that fish. The French call it <i>Dauphinelle</i>, <i>pied
d’alouette</i>, <i>l’épéron de chevalier</i>, (knight’s spur;) and the Italian,
<i>speronella</i>, (little spur,) <i>sperone di cavaliere</i>, (knight’s spur,)
and <i>fior regio</i>, (king-flower.) These names give quite a chivalric
importance to the gentle flower, and furnish abundant subject for
thought and fancy. Our own rural names give us a picture of the
sky-lark; that “musical cherub,” soaring far and high into the blue
summer heaven, above the lonely mountain-top, or over the busy town, and
we can recall the delight of listening to his sweet melody.</p>

<h2><a id="Dyers_Weed_Relief"></a><span class="smcap">Dyer’s Weed</span>.... <i>Relief</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyer</span>’s Weed is like a very large upright plant of Mignonette, to which
sweet exotic it is nearly related, both being members of the <i>reseda</i>
family. The <i>Reseda odorata</i>, or Mignonette, is a native of Egypt, and
was introduced into England in 1752. The word <i>reseda</i> is from <i>resedo</i>,
to calm, to appease. The plants were thought useful applications to
external bruises, to ease pain. There are two species growing wild in
England. <i>Reseda lutea</i>, or Base-rocket, likes a chalky soil, but <i>R.
luteola</i>, the Dyer’s Weed, is often found on waste ground everywhere. It
is much used by dyers, particularly in France. It affords a most
beautiful yellow dye, for cotton, woollen, mohair, silk, and linen. Blue
cloths dipped in a decoction of it become green. The entire plant, when
about to flower, is pulled up, and employed both fresh and dried. Like
the Coltsfoot, this plant is among the first which spring from the
rubbish thrown out of coal-pits. Linnæus observed, that the nodding
spike of flowers always follows the sun, even on a cloudy day, pointing
eastward in a morning, southward at noon, westward in the afternoon, and
northward at night. If this be true, it may supplant the sunflower in
the favour of sentimental florists, for the inconstancy of that has long
been proved. Good old Gerarde, who evidently did his best to believe all
things, says, that he has seen four sunflowers on one stem, pointing to
the four cardinal points. I am wan<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_167">{167}</a></span>dering from my subject, but must
remind you of some sweet lines by that poet of nature&mdash;Clare, where he
groups the sunflower so nicely; and you may look at that cottage, where
the children are playing, and see the picture nearly realized:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to the belief of the ancients, Truth was the mother of Virtue,
the daughter of Time, and queen of the world. It is a frequent saying,
that Truth lies at the bottom of a well, and that she always mingles
some bitterness with her sweet blessings; and we have chosen for her
emblem a plant which, like her, delights in the shade, and is evergreen.
The Nightshade is the only plant in England which loses and reproduces
its leaves twice a year.</p>

about the face of Heaven, the homeless winds, and the crystal-globed
dews, that settle upon thy blossoms like sleep on the veined eyelids of
an infant, are ever beating above and around thee, as if to tell that
they rejoice in thy companionship, and that, although a thousand years
have strided by with silent steps, time hath not abated an atom of their
love. Who can tell the thoughts of Saxon Alfred when, wandering alone,
crownless and sceptreless, he stretched himself on the lonely moor
beneath the shadow of thy golden blossoms, sighing for the fair queen he
had left far behind? When he bowed his kingly head, and, musing on thy
beauty, buried in a solitary wild, thought how even regal dignity would
be enhanced by humility, and that, although thou didst grow there
unmarked and unpruned, not a more princely flower waved in his own
English garden.</p>

<h2><a id="Vervain_Enchantment"></a><span class="smcap">Vervain</span>.... <i>Enchantment</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Vervain</span> was employed by the ancients in various kinds of divinations.
They ascribed to it a thousand properties, and, among others, that of
reconciling enemies. Whenever the Romans sent their heralds to offer
peace or war to nations, one of them always carried a sprig of Vervain.
The Druids, both in Gaul and Britain, regarded the Vervain with the same
veneration as the misletoe, and offered sacrifices to the earth before
they cut this plant in spring, which was a ceremony of great pomp.
Though the Druids and their religion have passed away, the Vervain is
still the plant of spells and enchantment. In the northern provinces of
France, the shepherds gather it with ceremonies and words known only to
themselves, and express its juices under certain phases of the moon.
They insist that this plant enables them to cure their ailments, and to
cast a spell on their daughters and cattle, by which they can make them
conform to their wishes.</p>

<h2><a id="Corn_Riches"></a><span class="smcap">Corn</span>.... <i>Riches</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Ceres</span>, the goddess of Corn and harvest, was represented with a garland
of ears of Corn on her head. The commemoration of the loss of her
daughter Proserpine, was celebrated about the beginning of harvest; that
of her search after her, at the time of sowing Corn. A whole straw has
been made the emblem of union; and a broken straw, of rupture. The
custom of breaking a straw, to express the rupture of a contract, may be
traced back to an early period of French history, and may be said to
have had a royal origin. When Charles the Simple, of France, was
abandoned by his principal lords, they broke a straw to express that
they would no longer acknowledge him as their king. Corn may be regarded
as an appropriate emblem of wealth; since, wherever it grows, it leads
us to infer plenty and comfort.</p>

<h2><a id="Holly_Foresight"></a><span class="smcap">Holly</span>.... <i>Foresight</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Holly, with its scarlet berries, is the most beautiful of the
evergreens that have been used for ages to adorn the churches of old
England, during the Christmas season. It is an ornament to the woods,
stripped bare by the rude breath of winter; its berries serve for food
for the little birds that never leave us, and its foliage affords them
an hospitable shelter during the cold season. Nature, by a seeming
forethought, has been careful to preserve the verdure of this handsome
tree all the year round, and to arm it with thorns, that it may furnish
both food and protection to the innocent creatures which resort to it
for shelter. It may be added, however, that from the bark of the common
Holly, when fermented and washed from the woody fibres, is made the
bird-lime which is used for catching small birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Meadow Saffron, or Colchicum Autumnale, springs up about the time
the leaves begin to fall from the trees, and may, therefore, be said to
proclaim to all nature, that the bright days of summer are past.
According to Ovid, this autumnal flower owes its origin to some drops of
the magic liquor prepared by Medea, to restore the aged Æson to the
bloom and vigour of youth, which were spilled in the fields. As a
medicine, the Colchicum is powerful, but dangerous, and must be used
with caution. The poisonous quality of the plant seems to be known, as
if by instinct, to all kinds of cattle. They all shun it, and in many
pastures this alone will be found standing, when all other herbage has
been consumed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fable</span> gives the following account of the origin of the signification of
the Hazel. There was a time when men were at constant war with each
other, and could not be restrained from cruelty and revenge by any tie
of kin. The gods at length took pity on them. Apollo and Mercury made
presents to each other, and descended to the earth. The god of harmony
received from the son of Maia the shell of a tortoise, out of which he
had constructed a lyre, and gave him in exchange a Hazel stick, which
had the power of imparting a love of virtue and of reconciling hearts
divided by envy and hate. By the power thus given him, Mercury taught
men the love of peace, and of home and country, and made commerce the
bond of nations. Adorned with two light wings, and entwined with
serpents, the Hazel rod given to the god of eloquence by the god of
harmony is still, by the name of caduceus, the emblem of peace,
commerce, and reconciliation.</p>

<h2><a id="Yew_Sorrow"></a><span class="smcap">Yew</span>.... <i>Sorrow</i>.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Yew is among all nations an emblem of sorrow. Its bare trunk, and
dark foliage, with which its fruit, looking like drops of blood, stands
in harsh contrast, excite in us a sort of aversion. Persons who sleep
under a Yew tree are liable to be seized with dizziness, heaviness, and
violent headache. Its juice is poisonous, and the tree exhausts the soil
which supports it, and destroys all other plants which spring up beneath
it. The Yew was planted in old English burying-grounds, and its wood was
commonly employed for making bows and arrows before the introduction of
fire-arms. The Greeks, impressed with the melancholy aspect of this
tree, invented the fable of the unhappy Smilax; who, seeing that her
love was rejected by young Crocus, was transformed into a Yew.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sere.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heaped in the hollow of the grove, the withered leaves lie dead;<br></span>
<span class="i0">They rustle to the eddying gust and to the rabbit’s tread.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrub the jay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And from the wood-top calls the crow, through all the gloomy day.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where are the flowers, the young fair flowers, that lately sprang and stood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! they all are in their graves; the gentle race of flowers<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are lying in their lonely beds, with the fair and good of ours.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The rain is falling where they lie: but the cold November rain<br></span>
<span class="i0">Calls not, from out the gloomy earth, the lovely ones again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wind-flower and the violet, they perished long ago,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the wild-rose and the orchis died, amid the summer glow;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_258">{258}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">But on the hill the golden-rod, and the aster in the wood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the yellow sunflower by the brook, in autumn beauty stood,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven, as falls the plague on men,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the brightness of their smile was gone, from upland, glade, and glen.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now, when comes the calm mild day, as still such days will come,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home;<br></span>
<span class="i0">When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sighs to find them in the wood and by the streams no more.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side:<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the cold moist earth we laid her, when the forest cast the leaf,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not unmeet it was that one, like that young friend of ours,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers.<br></span>

<p>When a plant is approaching its state of perfection, when its organs of
nourishment are completely developed, and its vegetation is most
luxuriant, then arrives the time of flowering, which has been aptly
termed “the joy of plants.” The most superficial observer must have
noticed how different is the season of flowering of individual plants,
and how each month is adorned with its particular flowers. When the
intense cold of January confines us to our houses, the Black Hellebore,
or Christmas Rose, unfolds its dazzling white blossoms; in February, the
innocent Snowdrop presents to us her elegant cup. In the same month the
Hazel puts forth its catkins, and not rarely the early-blooming Crowfoot
shows the blue tips of its clusters of blossom. March boasts a richer
Flora; then the Violet delights us with its fragrance; the Mezereon
offers its peach-<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_295">{295}</a></span>coloured flowers, and the Primrose leads on a long
train of the charming children of Spring. These now continue to advance
in increasing numbers, displaying, especially in May and June, their
highest splendour; till at length the Meadow Saffron takes leave of
inclement Autumn, and, saturated with rain, the Mosses acquire fresh
vigour, and open to the botanist a new field for investigation.</p>

<p>Not less different than the period of flowering is the time of the
opening and shutting of flowers. Some plants habitually open and close
their flowers by turns; others are governed in these respects by the
weather; others again, by the length or shortness of the day: while some
open and shut at certain hours, and thus furnish materials for composing
the Dial of Flowers.</p>

<p>According to the observations of later botanists, the flowery crown of
plants serves, among other things, to envelop the tender organs of
fructification, and to protect them from the pernicious influence of
external agents. Those organs of fructification are the chief objects of
the maternal care of Nature; while shut up in the flower-bud, they
acquire that strength and perfection of parts which enable them to
endure the light of the sun, and to perform the functions for which they
are designed. It is not till they are capable of fulfilling these
functions that the flower unfolds itself; but it again closes at such
times when external influences might be injurious to the delicate organs
of fructification. Many flowers can bear only the refreshing morning air
and the first rays of the sun, but remain shut all the rest of the day.
This may be particularly observed in the different species of
Convolvulus, Ipomæa,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_296">{296}</a></span> and Goat’s Beard. We find these, in general, open
only till about eleven o’clock. In like manner, the Mallows and the
Mesembryanthemums unfold their flowers about noon: and precisely at that
time, in serene weather, open the singularly-formed Drosera, and the
common Purslain, which shut again in an hour. Others unfold themselves
only in the evening, and continue open all night, probably because their
delicate organs would be injured by the sun. The Œnotheras, the Gauras,
and the different species of the Mirabilis, furnish examples of this
kind. Thus, too, the Cactus opuntia opens its magnificent blossoms at
night only, and towards morning shuts them up for ever. The flowers of
many plants of the nineteenth class are observed to hang their heads
during night&mdash;the Camellia, for example&mdash;by which means the rain, or
dew, which might injure the tender organs of fructification, can run off
the more easily. In other plants of this class, the flower shuts up
against rain, and on the approach of evening, as is the case with the
Marigolds.</p>

<p>The periodical change of colour in some flowers is also worthy of
remark. Thus, the flowers of the speckled French Honeysuckle (<i>Hedysarum
maculatum</i>) are purple in the morning and green at noon. The changeable
Hibiscus (<i>Hibiscus mutabilis</i>) is white in the morning, flesh-coloured
at noon, and rose-red in the evening. Thus, too, the great Corn-flag
(<i>Gladiolus grandis</i>) changes its colour several times in the course of
the day.</p>

<p>Neither is the scent of flowers equally strong and agreeable at all
hours of the day: many, even of our indigenous flowers, have the
strongest scent at night.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_297">{297}</a></span> The <i>Ixia cinnamomea</i> gives out its fragrance
in the evening only; the highly-scented Lesser Orpine (<i>Crassula
odoratissima</i>) only in the night; the <i>Epidendrum fragrans</i>, morning and
evening; another species of Epidendrum, hung up in a room, without earth
or water, yields an agreeable perfume for years. The flowers of the
<i>Hebenstreitia dentata</i> are scentless in the morning, have a
disagreeable smell at noon, and give out in the evening a fragrant
odour, not unlike that of the Hyacinth.</p>

<p>These properties of flowers, and the opening and shutting of many at
particular times of the day, led to the idea of planting them in such a
manner as to indicate the succession of the hours, and to make them
supply the place of a watch or clock. Those who are disposed to try the
experiment may easily compose such a dial by consulting the following
table, comprehending the hours between three in the morning and eight in
the evening.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_298">{298}</a></span></p>

<p>It is, of course, impossible to ensure the accurate going of such a
dial, because the temperature, the dryness, and the dampness of the air,
have a considerable influence on the opening and shutting of flowers.</p>
